# Samsung-Galaxy-Data-Wrangling
  I took the provided UCI data and first used the suggested make.names function to structure the features file so it would match up with the collected data. I then used it as labels for the data and combine the test and training sets for the data, subjects, and activity numbers. Now that I had one large, complete dataset (Combine), I could extract the mean and standard deviations of each measurement. I stored this in a 2nd dataset, Combine2. Then I used the piping operator to group the data by subject and activity and take the mean of the grouped data. This final data set is saved as Combine3.
